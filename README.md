## Project's File Structure

### AZURE_RTOS

Initialization files for Azure RTOS, laying the groundwork for real-time
operating system functionalities crucial for managing the car's operations.

### Core

Source files primarily responsible for initializing STM32, featuring
auto-generated code to establish the foundational aspects of the car's control
systems.

### Drivers

STM32 BSP (Board Support Package) drivers and custom libraries tailored to the
specific requirements of the FSAE car.

Configs: Configuration loader aiding in firmware setup, enabling dynamic
adjustments and optimizations for different racing scenarios.

Sensors: Repository for sensor-related functionalities, encompassing modules for
interfacing with various sensors crucial for monitoring the car's performance.
ADC: Analog-to-Digital Converter functionalities for precise data acquisition
from analog sensors. IMU: Inertial Measurement Unit functionalities for accurate
motion tracking and vehicle dynamics analysis. Traction: Components related to
traction control mechanisms, optimizing the car's traction under varying driving
conditions. Inverter: Modules responsible for managing inverters, enhancing
power delivery efficiency and control.

### FileX

Integration of FileX, a high-performance file system optimized for deeply
embedded applications, facilitating data logging and storage functionalities
vital for post-race analysis and system diagnostics.

### Tasks

Task-specific files organizing code based on operational tasks within the FSAE
car, facilitating modularity and scalability in system development and
maintenance.

This meticulously structured approach ensures a robust foundation for developing
an embedded system tailored specifically for the unique requirements and
challenges posed by the high-performance environment of an FSAE car. From
low-level hardware initialization to high-level task management and control
algorithms, each directory serves a distinct purpose in enabling efficient
development, deployment, and maintenance of the embedded system driving the FSAE
car to success on the track.
